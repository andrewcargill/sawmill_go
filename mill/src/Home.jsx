      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <h5>I am a computer programmer and forest owner in
        North of Sweden.</h5>
      <p>
        I own a small forest of around 30 hectares with various sections
        and ages of forests. I came into this totally new five years ago when 
        I moved to a small village outside of Ume√•, after living in Stockholm for 10 years.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I own a bandsaw mill and mill for my own projects. From learning about
        the forest industry and the price of wood and industry methods I really wanted to do 
        something to share the extra work, time and love that goes into selective forestry
        and the milling on wood on a small scale. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Selective cut forestry is the way most forest owners would want to management
        their forests, but it just isn't cost effect. So I wanted to find a way to 
        make a preimum product.
